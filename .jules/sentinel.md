## 2026-02-14 - Stored XSS via Job URL
**Vulnerability:** Job URLs stored in Firestore were rendered without sanitization in the `href` attribute, allowing "javascript:" schemes to execute malicious code (Stored XSS). Additionally, external links lacked `rel="noopener noreferrer"`, exposing users to Reverse Tabnabbing attacks.
**Learning:** Even internal tools or personal apps need strict input validation. The `input type="url"` client-side validation is insufficient as data can be manipulated or bypassed.
**Prevention:** Always sanitize user-provided URLs before rendering them. Use a strict allowlist for protocols (http, https). Ensure external links use `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
